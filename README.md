# Python Class Design & Polymorphism Challenge üêçüé≠

## Overview
This repository contains a Python program showcasing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, specifically focusing on class design, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Features:

## Assignment 1: Design a class representing objects (e.g., Smartphone, Book, or Superhero).
## Assignment 2: Demonstrate Polymorphism through a program with animals or vehicles that perform the same action (e.g., move()) in different ways.

# Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class üèóÔ∏è
In this activity, I created a class called Smartphone that simulates basic smartphone functions. The class has the following attributes:
* brand: The brand of the smartphone.
* model: The model of the smartphone.
* color: The color of the smartphone.
* price: The price of the smartphone.
* storage: The storage capacity in GB.
* battery_percentage: The battery percentage of the smartphone.

*Methods:* 
charge(amount): Charges the smartphone by a specified percentage.
check_battery(): Displays the current battery percentage.
display_info(): Displays the smartphone's details.
Inheritance & Encapsulation:
I explored inheritance by creating an abstract class Vehicle and extending it with Car, Plane, and Bicycle. Each subclass implements the move() method differently, showing polymorphism in action.

Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge üé≠
Problem:
Create a program where different vehicle types (e.g., Car, Plane, and Bicycle) all share a common method called move(), but each vehicle moves differently.

Vehicles:
Car: The car moves by driving.
Plane: The plane moves by flying.
Bicycle: The bicycle moves by pedaling.
